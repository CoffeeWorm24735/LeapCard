LEAP CARD 

This is an app that I am devolping on the side for the TFI LeapCard transportation ticketing system.
In its final version it will be able to add a users LeapCard to the Apple Wallet
Cureently the app is in beta in TestFlight with only the reader enabled but no output given to the user 
I am currently appling for the Apple NFC certificate which will allow me to completely emulate the LeapCard and its behavours 
I hope to have the app ready for full Public release sometime in November
